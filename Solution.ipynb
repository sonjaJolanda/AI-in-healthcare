    "In this practical course, we are going to focus on arrhythmia which symptoms include palpitations,\n",

    "In this practical course, you are tasked with formulating and defining a research question to be answered the available dataset. By developing a focused research question, the aim is to analyse the data systematically and draw meaningful conclusions that contribute to the understanding of the subject matter. Here are some examples of papers dealing with cardiac arrhythmia detection [5] [6] [7].\n",
    "- Task 2: Data exploration: \n",
    "Data exploration is a crucial step before analysing data. Your task now consists of the following:\n",
    "    - Summarise key statistics (min, max, and other relevant metrics) to understand the datasetâ€™s characteristics.\n",
    "    - Analyse the distribution of the different features.\n",
    "    - Detect outliers within the dataset that may impact analysis accuracy and reliability.\n",
    "- Task 3: Data analysis:\n",
    "The quality of data analysis outcomes is directly influenced by the quality of the underlying data.\n",
    "    - Perform pre-processing steps (data cleaning, feature normalization, and selection, etc.) to prepare the dataset for analysis.\n",
    "    - What types of transformations would you recommend for this dataset? Explain why these transformations are beneficial for enhancing data quality and improving analysis outcomes.\n",
    "    - What types of features can be extracted from the signals in the dataset and are most relevant and important for addressing the research question effectively?\n",
    "- After completing pre-processing and feature extraction, apply (at least) two ML and/or deep learning techniques of your choice (one simple and one complex technique) to the pre-processed\n",
    "data. Evaluate the obtained results and assess how well they address the research question. More particularly, perform hyperparameters tuning if necessary and determine the most important factors\n",
